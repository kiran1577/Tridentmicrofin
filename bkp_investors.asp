          2004 by S.Viswanatha Prasad as an investment management company 
          focused on managing investment funds in the microfinance space. In May 
          2005, Caspian and two foreign social investors came together to set up 
          India’s first microfinance equity fund in the private sector - The 
          Bellwether Microfinance Equity Fund. More recently, in Aug 2008, 
          Caspian launched its second microfinance equity fund – The India 
          Financial Inclusion Fund. The investment team at Caspian has a 
          combined experience of more than 60 years in the areas of 
          developmental finance, mainstream banking &amp; investment banking.</span></p>

          <span class="body"><b>Bellwether Microfinance Fund (“Bellwether”)</b> was 
          designed as an onshore India focused microfinance venture fund that 
          would be independently managed by Caspian. Bellwether is a US$ 20 
          million fund with Gray Ghost Fund LLC, USA, Hivos Triodos Fund, 
          Netherlands and FMO, Netherlands as the key investors. It caters to 
          the equity and quasi-equity needs of Microfinance Institutions (“MFIs”) 
          that have the potential to grow substantially, given a supply of 
          necessary resources. Reflecting the experience of successful MFIs 
          around the world, the Bellwether Fund couples financial support in the 
          critical first few years of the MFIs’ operations with close 
          operational support, oversight and access to domestic financial 
          markets.</span></p>
              <p align="justify">
          <span class="body">Bellwether is essentially an equity fund and its 
          primary financial instrument is risk capital. Any investment made by 
          the Fund, even if structured as debt or quasi-equity would have the 
          overarching objective of an equity stake in the MFI. As a strategic 
          investor and given the extensive microfinance experience of its 
          management team, the Fund plays an active governance role and assists 
          the investee organizations in strengthening their financial and 
          management systems. Debt is generally offered by the Fund to an MFI 
          with whom an equity relationship already exists. In exceptional cases, 
          debt may be considered if the Fund has the option to invest in the 
          MFI’s equity in the future, or in the event the investment is 
          furthering the overall investment strategy of the Fund. Bellwether 
          offers value added services to help young organizations integrate with 
          the mainstream financial sector like:</span></p>
