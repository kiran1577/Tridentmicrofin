                  </b>Working as a manual worker at a nearby industrial unit in 
                  Fatehnagar, Susheelamma earned a meagre Rs. 1500/- per month 
                  with the day’s hard work. This combined with her husband’s 
                  income of another Rs. 2000/- was not enough to meet their 
                  monthly expenses, leave alone sending the children to school. 
                  And the income was not constant as the work was intermittent. 
                  The very sight of school going children on the street would 
                  sadden her as she was unable to send her own kids to school. </span>

              going to school by sending her children to a good school and see 
              them as better citizens tomorrow. This determination ignited a 
              spark in her to increase her family income and see to it that she 
              gives a better life to her children.</span></p>
              <p align="justify">
          <span class="body"><font face="Calibri" style="font-size:9.5pt">With such intention, she approached the local 
              moneylender as well as the nearby banks for a small loan to start 
              her own tea stall, but was bluntly refused due to lack of any 
              collateral security. With her hopes shattered, she continued with 
              her normal work when one fine day she heard from one of her friend 
              about a Micro Finance Institution (MFI) that supports the 
              entrepreneurial poor people financially. Sensing her long wished 
              opportunity of entrepreneurship within her reach, she thought, 
              “This is the best route to get away from this drudgery (given my 
              present skill-set) and supplement my husband’s income so as to 
              care for the 3 children as well as the elderly mother-in-law”. She 
              immediately rushed to the MFI with her proposal which was taken up 
              with gravity and the process of funding soon started.</span></p>
              <p align="justify">
          <span class="body"><font face="Calibri" style="font-size:9.5pt">What started her off in her tea-stall venture was a 
              small loan of Rs. 4000/- from the MFI which was to be repaid at 
              the rate of about Rs. 90/- per week over a period of 50 weeks 
              which she comfortably started paying off from her daily earnings 
              of approximately Rs. 200/-. </span></p>

          <span class="body"><font face="Calibri" style="font-size:9.5pt">All this, even though there existed a competing tea

          <span class="body"><font face="Calibri" style="font-size:9.5pt">Her dream which had been to work independently came 
              true (it is incidental that her stall is under the lower portion 
              of an unpainted Railway Over Bridge – home to various parked 
              vehicles). Apart from being an earning member, her husband too has 
              joined this trade and partners her, which has increased her 
              respectability in addition to halving her workload.</span></p>

              60,000/- now, Susheelamma saves about Rs, 5,000/- annually after 
              meeting all the household expenses. She also sends all her 
              children to a good school nearby. Further, on the economic front 
              not only have assets been purchased for the home but emergency 
              needs too are managed after meeting all the family’s needs. </span>

              <p align="justify">

              that not only has my lifestyle changed but also enabled me to

              greater freedom to choose the desired lifestyle. So radical is the

              relative from overseas who was delighted at Anjum’s exquisite 
              cross-stitch work changed the life of Anjum after she was 
              encouraged to convert her work into petit point – a fine kind of 
              embroidery that she pursued as a hobby. The fineness of the work 
              may be gauged from the fact that it takes over a year to petit 
              point a saree border – when working continuously! This involved 
              work of such a high order that the raw material that was very 
              expensive proved to be the stumbling block. It was then that 
              Trident, a micro-finance institute, had stepped in to bail her out 
              of this situation with a credit intervention of Rs. 8000 in 
              November 2006. Most of the loan amount was spent towards acquiring 
              the raw material, mainly the fine embroidery thread available in 
              different colours. She managed the entire embroidery all by 
              herself since it was extremely skill dependent. The petit point 
              work had to be kept wrapped in cloth in order to prevent it from 
              getting dirty.</span></p>
              <p align="justify"><span class="body"><font face="Calibri" style="font-size:9.5pt">A devout follower of Islam, 
              Anjum was a housewife before turning into an entrepreneur. Unlike 
              a large family with many children and multiple sisters-in-law, 
              that is most common among the Muslim community, Anjum stayed 
              separately with her husband Sheikh Afzal and three kids. Being a 
              housewife, she has had to juggle both the home as well as the 
              trade for which a compromise has been found with everyone pitching 
              in to help her. She says “I wanted to fashion an enterprise so 
              that I could work from home and not have to go out”. </span></p>
              <p align="justify"><span class="body"><font face="Calibri" style="font-size:9.5pt">Since this work was found to 
              be very expensive by the contemporary society, she has yet to 
              complete a sale of the saree but has been filling her free time 
              with small patch work for decorating dresses and regularly 
              repaying her loan from these other earnings. The work on a single 
              piece was very time consuming so she reduced her downtime by 
              turning out small pieces of embroidery work which had a quick 
              turnover too.</span></p>
              <p align="justify"><span class="body"><font face="Calibri" style="font-size:9.5pt">Even though completely 
              lacking in a formal school education, she is now a much sought 
              after person offering advice to various persons in her society 
              about microfinance. Other pillars of support to her were the 
              members of the family and society who supported her in the chosen 
              enterprise. Since the skill was native to the main person, Sheikh 
              Afzal could not help his wife with the petit point, but did help 
              in the logistics part of the purchasing and transport of the raw 
              material as well as finished goods in his auto-trolley. Apart from 
              sharing the workload, he had made a customized wooden frame to fit 
              the saree to be embroidered so that Anjum could pursue her chosen 
              work with ease. With their sufficient income, they could send 
              their girl child also to school who otherwise are normally 
              neglected among the poor Indian families.<br>
              <br>
              The 3rd standard educated Shahnaaz, a neighbor of Anjum used to 
              lead a hand-to-mouth existence with her very meagre basket of 
              family income during her days as a manual laborer which would only 
              suffice to supplement her husband’s meager income in order to make 
              ends meet. Here too, poverty forced upon her the dignity of a 
              nuclear family and she would dream of an ample income for which 
              she experimented with contract work for readymade dresses which 
              did not bring in much income inspite of all the long hours of 
              work. The earlier works were not dangerous and did not involve 
              work in an unhealthy environment but obtaining work or getting 
              properly paid for the work were proving to be problems.</span></p>
              <p align="justify"><span class="body"><font face="Calibri" style="font-size:9.5pt">She realized that her native 
              manual embroidery skill was still in demand in spite of the 
              machine made variations available in the market. It was her 
              husband who provided the initial impetus to start her on a 
              dress-making trade on her own. Her peers and neighbors who were 
              also members of a self-help-group informed her of the microfinance 
              interventions of Trident and she found the way out for her 
              enterprise after her unhappy attempts at obtaining loans from the 
              banks or the moneylender. Some simple formalities later, she was 
              the proud possessor of a loan of Rs. 6000 from the Trident which 
              enabled her to marry her embroidery skills to the commercial 
              skills. The Rs. 6000 launched her into this enterprise of 
              embroidering dresses and sarees. However unlike many others, she 
              does not stock any input and purchases just what would be 
              sufficient for the business at hand.</span></p>

              pros and cons. She also proposes to purchase a sewing machine 
              and/or start soap as well as a perfume making unit in order to
